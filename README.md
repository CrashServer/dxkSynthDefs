# DxkSynthDefs
some synth defs for SuperCollider

- dxkDrums - a collection of percussion synthdefs
- dxkLoopers - loopers
- dxkSimpleDelay - wrappers around Delay UGens
- dxkSimpleOsc - wrappers around oscillator UGens
- dxkSynthsMisc - various synthesizers (such as DTMF)

NOT MINE (mostly for archival/collection purposes)

- notMineDrums - so far, only adapted cymbal808_ryan (but reintroduced use of baseFreq)
