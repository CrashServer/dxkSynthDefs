# DxkSynthDefs
some synth defs for SuperCollider

(note: files/synthdefs with dxkX instead of plain dxk use XOut, usually for effects synthdefs)

- dxkDrums - a collection of percussion synthdefs
- dxkFx - processing synthdefs
- dxkLoopers - loopers
- dxkModal - modal synthesis
- dxkPitched - various other pitched synthdefs
- dxkReverb - reverberator synthdefs
- dxkSimpleDelay - wrappers around Delay UGens
- dxkSimpleOsc - wrappers around oscillator UGens
- dxkSimpleVerb - wrappers around reverb UGens
- dxkSynthsMisc - various synthesizers (such as DTMF)

NOT MINE (mostly for archival/collection purposes)

- notMineSynths - adapted cymbal808_ryan, varioussmallfires's fm-gong, sccode coreyker's detuned synth pad and with some code cleaning
